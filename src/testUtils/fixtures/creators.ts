The original, profiled base of Carrara marble has been replaced by a high, smooth base. The statue stood for 161 years at Slussen, before it was moved in November 2015 in connection with the start of the renovation of Slussen. The statue was given a provisional location next to the Royal Castle. In 2018, when the 200-year memory of the Bernadotte family's access to the Swedish throne was noticed, it was decided that the statue would be permanently placed on Slottsbacken. The original base is now available in the City Museum's collections. The work is owned and managed by Statens Fastighetsverk. ",

The father was the court bridge, as well as his sisters, the bridges Anna Sibylla Sergell (another name version is Anna Brita Sergell) and Maria Sofia Sergell.\r\n\r\nSergel's talents were discovered early and he was taught by Jean Eric Rehn and Jacques Adrien Masreliez. In 1757, he began as a student of Pierre Hubert L'Archevêque, who was called from France, who modeled Gustav II Adolf's statue, Stockholm. He also assisted this in performing two statues for the royal castle. Another important event in his early development was his meeting with the engraver Per Floding, who introduced him in the nuanced style.\r\n",

                "description": "Bengt Erland Fogelberg, also Benedict Fogelberg, born August 8, 1786 at Drottninggatan 48 in Gothenburg, died December 22, 1854 in Trieste, Italy, was a Swedish sculptor. \r\nBengt Erland Fogelberg was the son of the gelbgutar Erland Fogelberg (1751-1811) and Maria Margaretha Lind (1781-1823). He was a gelbuggler pupil in Gothenburg and became 1804 apprentice to the court choir Rung in Stockholm. The same year he was enrolled as a student at the Art Academy in Stockholm, where he studied for Johan Tobias Sergel. Already in 1805 Fogelberg received his first reward and conquered the first medal at the academy three years in a row. In 1812 he became agré at the Academy of Fine Arts, a title that awarded promising younger artists, but who were not considered mature enough to be admitted as members. Only in 1832 did he become an academy member.\r\nFogelberg is described as shy and withdrawn and he had little contact with the Swedish artist colony, which gathered around Johan Niclas Byström in Rome. Fogelberg was interested in archeology and wrote a scientific work in the field. His interest in antiquity was expressed in, among other things, a very large collection of ancient terracotta figures, which were later bought by King Louis I of Bavaria, and exhibited in Munich. \r\nIn Rome he performed Hebe, a sculpture that demonstrates clear impressions from Thorvaldsen. Among his works should be mentioned a bronze bust of Gustav Vasa (the courtyard, Uppsala castle), Odin, Tor and Balder in marble (Nationalmuseum), Birger Earl and the equestrian statue of Karl XIV Johan at Slussen in Stockholm, and Gustav II Adolf in Gothenburg. The best of his sculptures is usually said to be the heavily modeled Tor, the herb type for a Nordic battlefield.\r\nIn 1854 he traveled to Sweden to participate in the unveiling of no less than three works, the two statues of Birger Earl and Karl XIV Johan in Stockholm and Gustav II Adolf's statue in Gothenburg. After the festivities in Gothenburg, Fogelberg traveled back to Italy, where he died in Trieste on December 22. Fogelberg is represented at the National Museum in Stockholm and the Gothenburg Art Museum.\r\n",
