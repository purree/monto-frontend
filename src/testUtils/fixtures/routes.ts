He was a gelbuggler pupil in Gothenburg and became 1804 apprentice to the court choir Rung in Stockholm. The same year he was enrolled as a student at the Art Academy in Stockholm, where he studied for Johan Tobias Sergel. Already in 1805 Fogelberg received his first reward and conquered the first medal at the academy three years in a row. In 1812 he became agré at the Academy of Fine Arts, a title that awarded promising younger artists, but who were not considered mature enough to be admitted as members. Only in 1832 did he become an academy member.\r\nFogelberg is described as shy and withdrawn and he had little contact with the Swedish artist colony, which gathered around Johan Niclas Byström in Rome. Fogelberg was interested in archeology and wrote a scientific work in the field. His interest in antiquity was expressed in, among other things, a very large collection of ancient terracotta figures, which were later bought by King Louis I of Bavaria, and exhibited in Munich. \r\nIn Rome he performed Hebe, a sculpture that demonstrates clear impressions from Thorvaldsen. Among his works should be mentioned a bronze bust of Gustav Vasa (the courtyard, Uppsala castle), Odin, Tor and Balder in marble (Nationalmuseum), Birger Earl and the equestrian statue of Karl XIV Johan at Slussen in Stockholm, and Gustav II Adolf in Gothenburg. The best of his sculptures is usually said to be the heavily modeled Tor, the herb type for a Nordic battlefield.\r\nIn 1854 he traveled to Sweden to participate in the unveiling of no less than three works, the two statues of Birger Earl and Karl XIV Johan in Stockholm and Gustav II Adolf's statue in Gothenburg. After the festivities in Gothenburg, Fogelberg traveled back to Italy, where he died in Trieste on December 22. Fogelberg is represented at the National Museum in Stockholm and the Gothenburg Art Museum.\r\n"

He was Stockholm's city architect between 1681 and 1715. Nicodemus Tessin the younger was born in Nyköping as son of Nicodemus Tessin the elder and Maria Persdotter Swahn. He was carried to the baptism by the widow Queen Maria Eleonora. Tessin attended the German school in Stockholm where he studied as an architect for the father. He showed early talent, and was drawn to a tribute to Charles XI printed. In 1664 he was enrolled during the Stockholm nation at Uppsala University, where he studied mathematics, French and Italian, and from 1671 he ended up under the widowed queen Hedvig Eleonora's protection, so he could go to Italy on a study trip in 1673.\r\nFor company he had the marquee del Monte, and they traveled via Germany to Verona, and visited Rome for a long time where Queen Kristina arranged for his education. Therefore he got to study for Lorenzo Bernini, as well as Carlo Fontana and Giovanni Pietro Bellori. As the Renaissance demanded, he received training in ancient aesthetics, especially the Roman. He returned to Sweden in 1678, and then had incomparable education, but was nevertheless sent to France and Louis XIV together with diplomat Daniel Cronström. From France, he received impetus and guidance from Charles Le Brun, André Le Nôtre and Jean Bérain. For a short time he stayed in England with Karl II where he came in contact with Christopher Wren. Several drawings have been preserved from these trips. \r\nIn 1680, Tessin was appointed leader of Hedvig Eleonora's buildings and was appointed chamberlain. In 1687–1688, he once again made his way to France and Italy, to draw inspiration from Drottningholm Castle's interior, when he became acquainted with Burchard Precht. The trip is documented in a diary. He had at that time succeeded the father as court and castle architect, and also became urban architect in Stockholm, the latter position together with his half-brother Abraham Winantz. On June 21, 1697, he was appointed as an overintendent, in 1701 to the Hull Marshal, and in 1705 to the Chief Marshal. For his efforts, he was elevated to dignified and dignified dignity.\r\nOver time, his administrative ambitions took over. In 1705 he became chancellor at Lund University and in connection with this he resigned as a city architect. Charles XII appointed him royal council and member of the Justice Review in 1712. His political career acquired him unfamiliar, and after Karl XII's death, he joined the Holstein Party and wanted to join an alliance with Russia, so in 1726 he ended up in despair and dismissed by Fredrik I. He died in 1728 and got a simple funeral in silence in Storkyrkan in Stockholm.\r\nNicodemus Tessin d.y. was the father of Carl Gustaf Tessin in his first marriage to Countess Hedvig Eleonora Stenbock. She died in 1714, and Tessin remarried in 1716 with the liberal professor Maria Barbro Horn of Marienborg, dead in 1725.\r\n"

He was trained as a carpenter in Umeå. In 1926 he became an ornament sculptor in Stockholm, and in 1928 a student of Carl Milles and Nils Sjögren at the Art Academy, where he was influenced by Aristide Maillol and Despiaus. Between 1934 and 1936 he made a trip to Italy and France as a fellow. In Paris he signed at Maison Watteau and Académie Colarossi. Modernism had reached considerably longer in France and Bror Marklund made a special impression of Ossip Zadkine and Henri Laurens. Others who left traces in his art were Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore. His art has been described as eroticistic primitivism, raw pagan style mixed with medieval features, and with brutality, ancientism and the monumental as a common theme. He himself said, \"Making a beautiful punk, it never went off.\" Bror Marklund was married twice, the first time in 1935–45 with Margit Eleonora Forsberg, and the second time from 1946 with actress Gun Robertson. Even one of his brothers, Oskar William Marklund, became a sculptor. Bror Marklund's first studio was at Tungelsta, the other was the church hall above the Ungkarlshotellet Glasbruket at Söder in Stockholm which in the 18th century was a home for fallen women. For a period he rented the chapel at Överjärna farm as a studio. He also had a studio in Funäsdalen in Härjedalen, where he liked the best.\r\n\r\nIn July 1938, the Historical Museum announced a competition for bronze gates for its building. Bror Marklund won the competition over 42 competitors and thus he became one of his contemporary most famous artists. The gates have the motto \"The Fathers' Heritage\", and are inspired by Jan Fridegård's novel Trägudar's Land (1940), Picasso's Guernica, Indian Art and the Fröstatyetten from the 1000s. Some of the main motifs of the gates are a pregnant woman, Oden, and Ansgar.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, Bror Marklund succeeded Bror Hjorth as Professor of Drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts, and became a member of the Art Academy in 1953. He received several awards during his lifetime, including the King's Medal and the Sergel Prize.\r\n\r\nÖrnsköldsvik municipality has established a scholarship for his memory.\r\n\r\nBror Marklund's summer studio from Funäsdalen was donated to Örnsköldsvik's municipality after his death and was moved and placed at Örnsköldsvik's museum and art gallery.\r\n"

The same year he was enrolled as a student at the Art Academy in Stockholm, where he studied for Johan Tobias Sergel. Already in 1805 Fogelberg received his first reward and conquered the first medal at the academy three years in a row. In 1812 he became agré at the Academy of Fine Arts, a title that awarded promising younger artists, but who were not considered mature enough to be admitted as members. Only in 1832 did he become an academy member.\r\nFogelberg is described as shy and withdrawn and he had little contact with the Swedish artist colony, which gathered around Johan Niclas Byström in Rome. Fogelberg was interested in archeology and wrote a scientific work in the field. His interest in antiquity was expressed in, among other things, a very large collection of ancient terracotta figures, which were later bought by King Louis I of Bavaria, and exhibited in Munich. \r\nIn Rome he performed Hebe, a sculpture that demonstrates clear impressions from Thorvaldsen. Among his works should be mentioned a bronze bust of Gustav Vasa (the courtyard, Uppsala castle), Odin, Tor and Balder in marble (Nationalmuseum), Birger Earl and the equestrian statue of Karl XIV Johan at Slussen in Stockholm, and Gustav II Adolf in Gothenburg. The best of his sculptures is usually said to be the heavily modeled Tor, the herb type for a Nordic battlefield.\r\nIn 1854 he traveled to Sweden to participate in the unveiling of no less than three works, the two statues of Birger Earl and Karl XIV Johan in Stockholm and Gustav II Adolf's statue in Gothenburg. After the festivities in Gothenburg, Fogelberg traveled back to Italy, where he died in Trieste on December 22. Fogelberg is represented at the National Museum in Stockholm and the Gothenburg Art Museum.\r\n"

During the 1630s, the work on the foundations of the present quay were begun, probably initiated by King Gustavus Adolphus. While the present name came into use during the period 1640-1700, the quay itself was not completed until 1854 when the area around Slussen was developed in connection to the construction of the lock of Nils Ericson.

                "description": "Stortorget is the oldest square in Stockholm. Trade arose when the paths met. In the middle of the square is the old pump. Collection at the pump was the cause of trade and gossip and was an important part of the medieval society. It was said that the pump had one of Stockholm's best waters. The current pump is from the 1770s.\r\nStortorget is forever associated with Stockholm's Blood Bath, which took place here in November 1520. The Danish king Kristian II defeated the Swedish regent Sten Sture the younger. King Kristian organized a coronation party at the castle and promised amnesty to anyone who had previously been his opponent. After three days of festivity, the castle gates were locked. After a summary trial, the supporters of the Sture Party were sentenced to death and 80 bishops and noblemen were executed right here at Stortorget.\r\nThe large red house with stairwell and white curbs is the Schantzka house. Skrönan says that the number of white stones is the same number as cut-off heads at Stockholm's bloodbath. It's a good story but unfortunately not true. The house is largely untouched since the 17th century when the house was owned by Johan Schantz who was secretary of Karl X Gustav.\r\n",

It is said that as long as these white stones remain in the facade the executed will have their peace but if a stone is lost then the person that the stone represented will no longer have peace and will become a ghost that will walk the city streets in eternity.

It is as well the ultimate place to embrace your inner swede and patiently wait in line until it’s your rightful turn to cross the alley. It has had a lot of different alias before and one example is the narrow staircase alley.The alley is named after the merchant and burgher Mårten Trotzig (1559–1617), who, born in Wittenberg, immigrated to Stockholm in 1581, and bought properties in the alley in 1597 and 1599, also opening a shop there.According to sources from the late-16th century, he dealt in iron and later copper, by 1595 he had sworn his burgher oath, and was later to become one of the richest merchants in Stockholm. He was however beaten to death during a trip to Kopparberg in 1617. (Wikipedia & ilovestockholm)\r\n \r\n",

Originally called Korntorget (\"Grain Square\"), the square is first mentioned as Järntorget in 1489, both names being used in parallel until 1513 when iron trade had surpassed corn trade in importance.

He was also the national treasurer of Gustav II Adolf and was adorned with the name von der Linde. The house is built in Dutch Renaissance style \r\nand was at that time one of the city's first and very lavish stone palace in German-Dutch Renaissance style. The decorations on the facades were done in Gotland sandstone and two of the adornments' faces have more human features than others. Theories exist that it is the builder himself and his wife who are depicted. The heads of the sandstone portal represent the gods of commerce and the sea, Mercury and Neptune. Queen Kristina then bought the house for her half-brother Count Gustaf Gustafsson of Vasaborg, who was the illegitimate son of Gustav II Adolf.\r\n",

He studied sculpture from 1940 to 1945 for Nils Sjögren at the Stockholm Academy of Fine Arts and later for Ossip Zadkine in Paris. He has mostly made himself known for his public works of art, which are found in about fifteen places in Sweden.\r\n\r\nWilly Gordon was active in Stockholm most of his life, and there are almost a dozen public sculptures, such as the Evert Taube statue at Riddarholmskajen (also a version in Grebbestad), Fruarna i Fruängen's center, Living ore outside LKAB's former headquarters at Karlavägen in Stockholm (also in Kiruna and at Physicum in Lund) and Flykten with Toran, originally a youth work from 1945, outside Stockholm's synagogue. At the Dramaten, as late as 2006, a portrait head was set up in bronze by Erland Josephson, originally in terracotta and from 1976. Most attention has been given to Gordon for his sculpture outside Östermalm's market hall, Meeting, which depicts a man wearing a piece of meat in front of one lying woman. The sculpture has caused protests and been vandalized on two occasions, most recently in December 2006.\r\n\r\nMany of Gordon's works depict, like meeting the human body, highly stylized, influenced by Zadkine, and also by a way that brings the thought of sculptors like Eric Grate and Henry Moore. He used crystalline and molecular structures in cells and rocks for original monumental works during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1990s, he won, together with architect Tsila Zak, a competition for a memorial site in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius to honor the centuries-old Jewish culture of the city.\r\n\r\nHe was married to the artist and calligraphic artist Mona Gordon.\r\n"

He was married in 1894-1911 with Jeanne Tramcourt and has with her son the sculptor Matts Eriksson.\r\nIn the mid-1870s, Christian Eriksson was an apprentice to an ornamental carpenter in Stockholm and studied at the Technical School at the same time. In 1877-1883, he worked as a furniture architect and modeling engineer at a furniture factory in Hamburg and then traveled to Paris, where he was a student at the École national supérieure des arts décoratifs and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts and worked in Alexandre Falguiere's studio. To support himself, he helped other artists with modeling and marble cutting. In 1888 he exhibited the statue Martyren at the Paris Salon and received a medal and scholarship for his debut work. However, the real breakthrough came the following year with the bronze vase Tjusning, which today is available at the National Museum and in 1890 the vase Blindbock, today at the Gothenburg Art Museum. In 1891, the great plaster relief Linnaeus was added, which in 1894 was made in marble for the National Museum and was erected there.\r\nChristian Eriksson's works are characterized by freshness, originality, and often with elements of humor.

He is considered one of the most significant artists of the late Middle Ages in Northern Europe.  Bernt Notke was active in Lübeck, where he became a master in 1467 and 1505 a master at Petri Church. Notke was also active in Stockholm between 1484 and 1496.\r\nOne of his more famous works is a famous painting series in Mariakyrkan in Lübeck. The painting series was destroyed when the church met during a bomb attack in 1942.\r\nThe most famous sculpture attributed to Notke is Sankt Göran and the dragon standing in Storkyrkan and as a replica at Köpmantorget, both in the Old Town in Stockholm. However, it is disputed whether the artwork is created by Notke or not, see the article of the sculpture.\r\nNotke was very productive and had great influence in Germany and Sweden. Fixed works by Notke are located in Sweden, Germany, Denmark and the Baltic States. Notke worked with an expressionist and intense style. His work is often very detailed.\r\nIn Estonia there is an altar cabinet from 1483 executed by him in the Holy Spirit Church (Püha Vaimu kirik) and his painting Death Dance in the Nikolaikyrik (Niguliste kirik), both in Tallinn's old town.\r\nIn addition, in 1477 he performed a triumphal crucifix for Lübeck's cathedral in 1477 and an altar work for Aarhus Cathedral in 1479. In Lübeck, he also performed a Luke altar and a St. John's wort, kept in Sankt-Annen-Kloster in Lübeck, the latter dated in 1496.\r\n"

He was a gelbuggler pupil in Gothenburg and became 1804 apprentice to the court choir Rung in Stockholm. The same year he was enrolled as a student at the Art Academy in Stockholm, where he studied for Johan Tobias Sergel. Already in 1805 Fogelberg received his first reward and conquered the first medal at the academy three years in a row. In 1812 he became agré at the Academy of Fine Arts, a title that awarded promising younger artists, but who were not considered mature enough to be admitted as members. Only in 1832 did he become an academy member.\r\nFogelberg is described as shy and withdrawn and he had little contact with the Swedish artist colony, which gathered around Johan Niclas Byström in Rome. Fogelberg was interested in archeology and wrote a scientific work in the field. His interest in antiquity was expressed in, among other things, a very large collection of ancient terracotta figures, which were later bought by King Louis I of Bavaria, and exhibited in Munich. \r\nIn Rome he performed Hebe, a sculpture that demonstrates clear impressions from Thorvaldsen. Among his works should be mentioned a bronze bust of Gustav Vasa (the courtyard, Uppsala castle), Odin, Tor and Balder in marble (Nationalmuseum), Birger Earl and the equestrian statue of Karl XIV Johan at Slussen in Stockholm, and Gustav II Adolf in Gothenburg. The best of his sculptures is usually said to be the heavily modeled Tor, the herb type for a Nordic battlefield.\r\nIn 1854 he traveled to Sweden to participate in the unveiling of no less than three works, the two statues of Birger Earl and Karl XIV Johan in Stockholm and Gustav II Adolf's statue in Gothenburg. After the festivities in Gothenburg, Fogelberg traveled back to Italy, where he died in Trieste on December 22. Fogelberg is represented at the National Museum in Stockholm and the Gothenburg Art Museum.\r\n"

After five years of residence, he returned to Paris, where he received several assignments. After Edme Bouchardon's younger brother, Jacques-Philippe, died in Stockholm in 1753, where he had been the royal court statue sculptor for twelve years, he negotiated with L'Archevêque that he would take over the sculptor position, and in 1755 he moved to Stockholm.\r\nSome time later, the chieftain Johan Christoffer von Düring raised proposals with the states about the erection of a statue of Gustav II Adolf. It was ordered in 1757, but only in 1796, after L'Archevêque had been dead for a long time, it arrived on Gustaf Adolf's square. In 1906 the two side groups were unveiled as Johan Tobias Sergel had created in 1789. Sergel was one of L'Archevêques' students.\r\nL'Archevêque also modeled the statue of Gustav Vasa at Riddarhustorget, uncovered in 1774. For the national hall of Stockholm's castle, he made at least four of the seven allegorical statues (Righteousness, Caution, Faithfulness and Religion), which four men came into place during his lifetime. He also performed several portraiture busts, including Jonas Alströmer, Olof von Dalin and Anders Plomgren, a grave monument over Gustaf von Seth in Byarum's church and participated in the adornment of King Adolf Fredrik's ministry and burial.\r\nL'Archevêque also performed part of the altarpiece to the castle church. He was also promoted to Director of Painting and the sculpture academy in Stockholm and became agrée at the painting academy in Paris. In 1768 he was elected as foreign member number 62 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. L'Archevêque is represented at the Gothenburg Art Museum  and the National Museum  in Stockholm.\r\n"

The original base is now available in the City Museum's collections. The work is owned and managed by Statens Fastighetsverk. ",

He was a gelbuggler pupil in Gothenburg and became 1804 apprentice to the court choir Rung in Stockholm. The same year he was enrolled as a student at the Art Academy in Stockholm, where he studied for Johan Tobias Sergel. Already in 1805 Fogelberg received his first reward and conquered the first medal at the academy three years in a row. In 1812 he became agré at the Academy of Fine Arts, a title that awarded promising younger artists, but who were not considered mature enough to be admitted as members. Only in 1832 did he become an academy member.\r\nFogelberg is described as shy and withdrawn and he had little contact with the Swedish artist colony, which gathered around Johan Niclas Byström in Rome. Fogelberg was interested in archeology and wrote a scientific work in the field. His interest in antiquity was expressed in, among other things, a very large collection of ancient terracotta figures, which were later bought by King Louis I of Bavaria, and exhibited in Munich. \r\nIn Rome he performed Hebe, a sculpture that demonstrates clear impressions from Thorvaldsen. Among his works should be mentioned a bronze bust of Gustav Vasa (the courtyard, Uppsala castle), Odin, Tor and Balder in marble (Nationalmuseum), Birger Earl and the equestrian statue of Karl XIV Johan at Slussen in Stockholm, and Gustav II Adolf in Gothenburg. The best of his sculptures is usually said to be the heavily modeled Tor, the herb type for a Nordic battlefield.\r\nIn 1854 he traveled to Sweden to participate in the unveiling of no less than three works, the two statues of Birger Earl and Karl XIV Johan in Stockholm and Gustav II Adolf's statue in Gothenburg. After the festivities in Gothenburg, Fogelberg traveled back to Italy, where he died in Trieste on December 22. Fogelberg is represented at the National Museum in Stockholm and the Gothenburg Art Museum.\r\n"

He was Stockholm's city architect between 1681 and 1715. Nicodemus Tessin the younger was born in Nyköping as son of Nicodemus Tessin the elder and Maria Persdotter Swahn. He was carried to the baptism by the widow Queen Maria Eleonora. Tessin attended the German school in Stockholm where he studied as an architect for the father. He showed early talent, and was drawn to a tribute to Charles XI printed. In 1664 he was enrolled during the Stockholm nation at Uppsala University, where he studied mathematics, French and Italian, and from 1671 he ended up under the widowed queen Hedvig Eleonora's protection, so he could go to Italy on a study trip in 1673.\r\nFor company he had the marquee del Monte, and they traveled via Germany to Verona, and visited Rome for a long time where Queen Kristina arranged for his education. Therefore he got to study for Lorenzo Bernini, as well as Carlo Fontana and Giovanni Pietro Bellori. As the Renaissance demanded, he received training in ancient aesthetics, especially the Roman. He returned to Sweden in 1678, and then had incomparable education, but was nevertheless sent to France and Louis XIV together with diplomat Daniel Cronström. From France, he received impetus and guidance from Charles Le Brun, André Le Nôtre and Jean Bérain. For a short time he stayed in England with Karl II where he came in contact with Christopher Wren. Several drawings have been preserved from these trips. \r\nIn 1680, Tessin was appointed leader of Hedvig Eleonora's buildings and was appointed chamberlain. In 1687–1688, he once again made his way to France and Italy, to draw inspiration from Drottningholm Castle's interior, when he became acquainted with Burchard Precht. The trip is documented in a diary. He had at that time succeeded the father as court and castle architect, and also became urban architect in Stockholm, the latter position together with his half-brother Abraham Winantz. On June 21, 1697, he was appointed as an overintendent, in 1701 to the Hull Marshal, and in 1705 to the Chief Marshal. For his efforts, he was elevated to dignified and dignified dignity.\r\nOver time, his administrative ambitions took over. In 1705 he became chancellor at Lund University and in connection with this he resigned as a city architect. Charles XII appointed him royal council and member of the Justice Review in 1712. His political career acquired him unfamiliar, and after Karl XII's death, he joined the Holstein Party and wanted to join an alliance with Russia, so in 1726 he ended up in despair and dismissed by Fredrik I. He died in 1728 and got a simple funeral in silence in Storkyrkan in Stockholm.\r\nNicodemus Tessin d.y. was the father of Carl Gustaf Tessin in his first marriage to Countess Hedvig Eleonora Stenbock. She died in 1714, and Tessin remarried in 1716 with the liberal professor Maria Barbro Horn of Marienborg, dead in 1725.\r\n"

Notke was also active in Stockholm between 1484 and 1496.\r\nOne of his more famous works is a famous painting series in Mariakyrkan in Lübeck. The painting series was destroyed when the church met during a bomb attack in 1942.\r\nThe most famous sculpture attributed to Notke is Sankt Göran and the dragon standing in Storkyrkan and as a replica at Köpmantorget, both in the Old Town in Stockholm. However, it is disputed whether the artwork is created by Notke or not, see the article of the sculpture.\r\nNotke was very productive and had great influence in Germany and Sweden. Fixed works by Notke are located in Sweden, Germany, Denmark and the Baltic States. Notke worked with an expressionist and intense style. His work is often very detailed.\r\nIn Estonia there is an altar cabinet from 1483 executed by him in the Holy Spirit Church (Püha Vaimu kirik) and his painting Death Dance in the Nikolaikyrik (Niguliste kirik), both in Tallinn's old town.\r\nIn addition, in 1477 he performed a triumphal crucifix for Lübeck's cathedral in 1477 and an altar work for Aarhus Cathedral in 1479. In Lübeck, he also performed a Luke altar and a St. John's wort, kept in Sankt-Annen-Kloster in Lübeck, the latter dated in 1496.\r\n"

He was a gelbuggler pupil in Gothenburg and became 1804 apprentice to the court choir Rung in Stockholm. The same year he was enrolled as a student at the Art Academy in Stockholm, where he studied for Johan Tobias Sergel. Already in 1805 Fogelberg received his first reward and conquered the first medal at the academy three years in a row. In 1812 he became agré at the Academy of Fine Arts, a title that awarded promising younger artists, but who were not considered mature enough to be admitted as members. Only in 1832 did he become an academy member.\r\nFogelberg is described as shy and withdrawn and he had little contact with the Swedish artist colony, which gathered around Johan Niclas Byström in Rome. Fogelberg was interested in archeology and wrote a scientific work in the field. His interest in antiquity was expressed in, among other things, a very large collection of ancient terracotta figures, which were later bought by King Louis I of Bavaria, and exhibited in Munich. \r\nIn Rome he performed Hebe, a sculpture that demonstrates clear impressions from Thorvaldsen. Among his works should be mentioned a bronze bust of Gustav Vasa (the courtyard, Uppsala castle), Odin, Tor and Balder in marble (Nationalmuseum), Birger Earl and the equestrian statue of Karl XIV Johan at Slussen in Stockholm, and Gustav II Adolf in Gothenburg. The best of his sculptures is usually said to be the heavily modeled Tor, the herb type for a Nordic battlefield.\r\nIn 1854 he traveled to Sweden to participate in the unveiling of no less than three works, the two statues of Birger Earl and Karl XIV Johan in Stockholm and Gustav II Adolf's statue in Gothenburg. After the festivities in Gothenburg, Fogelberg traveled back to Italy, where he died in Trieste on December 22. Fogelberg is represented at the National Museum in Stockholm and the Gothenburg Art Museum.\r\n"

In 1877-1883, he worked as a furniture architect and modeling engineer at a furniture factory in Hamburg and then traveled to Paris, where he was a student at the École national supérieure des arts décoratifs and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts and worked in Alexandre Falguiere's studio. To support himself, he helped other artists with modeling and marble cutting. In 1888 he exhibited the statue Martyren at the Paris Salon and received a medal and scholarship for his debut work. However, the real breakthrough came the following year with the bronze vase Tjusning, which today is available at the National Museum and in 1890 the vase Blindbock, today at the Gothenburg Art Museum. In 1891, the great plaster relief Linnaeus was added, which in 1894 was made in marble for the National Museum and was erected there.\r\nChristian Eriksson's works are characterized by freshness, originality, and often with elements of humor. He also made meritorious artifacts. Christian Eriksson has his resting place at Mikaelikyrkan \r\n"

He studied sculpture from 1940 to 1945 for Nils Sjögren at the Stockholm Academy of Fine Arts and later for Ossip Zadkine in Paris. He has mostly made himself known for his public works of art, which are found in about fifteen places in Sweden.\r\n\r\nWilly Gordon was active in Stockholm most of his life, and there are almost a dozen public sculptures, such as the Evert Taube statue at Riddarholmskajen (also a version in Grebbestad), Fruarna i Fruängen's center, Living ore outside LKAB's former headquarters at Karlavägen in Stockholm (also in Kiruna and at Physicum in Lund) and Flykten with Toran, originally a youth work from 1945, outside Stockholm's synagogue. At the Dramaten, as late as 2006, a portrait head was set up in bronze by Erland Josephson, originally in terracotta and from 1976. Most attention has been given to Gordon for his sculpture outside Östermalm's market hall, Meeting, which depicts a man wearing a piece of meat in front of one lying woman. The sculpture has caused protests and been vandalized on two occasions, most recently in December 2006.\r\n\r\nMany of Gordon's works depict, like meeting the human body, highly stylized, influenced by Zadkine, and also by a way that brings the thought of sculptors like Eric Grate and Henry Moore. He used crystalline and molecular structures in cells and rocks for original monumental works during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1990s, he won, together with architect Tsila Zak, a competition for a memorial site in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius to honor the centuries-old Jewish culture of the city.\r\n\r\nHe was married to the artist and calligraphic artist Mona Gordon.\r\n"

Notke was also active in Stockholm between 1484 and 1496.\r\nOne of his more famous works is a famous painting series in Mariakyrkan in Lübeck. The painting series was destroyed when the church met during a bomb attack in 1942.\r\nThe most famous sculpture attributed to Notke is Sankt Göran and the dragon standing in Storkyrkan and as a replica at Köpmantorget, both in the Old Town in Stockholm. However, it is disputed whether the artwork is created by Notke or not, see the article of the sculpture.\r\nNotke was very productive and had great influence in Germany and Sweden. Fixed works by Notke are located in Sweden, Germany, Denmark and the Baltic States. Notke worked with an expressionist and intense style. His work is often very detailed.\r\nIn Estonia there is an altar cabinet from 1483 executed by him in the Holy Spirit Church (Püha Vaimu kirik) and his painting Death Dance in the Nikolaikyrik (Niguliste kirik), both in Tallinn's old town.\r\nIn addition, in 1477 he performed a triumphal crucifix for Lübeck's cathedral in 1477 and an altar work for Aarhus Cathedral in 1479. In Lübeck, he also performed a Luke altar and a St. John's wort, kept in Sankt-Annen-Kloster in Lübeck, the latter dated in 1496.\r\n"

                "description": "The big fire was a fire that started on September 1st, 1625 in the Old Town of Stockholm. The fire started on the evening of September 1st, 1625 in a house at the bottom of Kåkbrinken. The fire became a catastrophe that completely destroyed the southwestern part of Stadsholmen. Two women, a brewer and a maid, had worked in Hendrich Tönisson's brewery and had not been careful enough. About ten pm the tower guard in Storkyrkan saw that smoke rose from the roof of the bridge house. [ At the time, hard wind from Lake Mälaren prevailed and the fire could not be stopped but spread rapidly among the wooden houses and the wood stores in the narrow alleys. The fire reached all the way to Västerlånggatan's stone house and for a while the German church (Tyska Kyrkan) was threatened. The church began to burn twice, but could be saved. In vain, attempts were made to stop the fire spreading with wet sails and clothing that spread out over the nape roof. The debt question was never clarified and words stood against words in the interrogation. Possibly the women in the brewing house had been sloppy or the chimney in poor condition. The brewer and maid were released after a good month against the bail. But at the same time, some of the city's firefighters were accused of their negligence. The church's tower guard was also accused. The result was a strengthening of fire prevention measures which meant that the fire and inspection would inspect chimneys and boards and ensure that the houses had the requested extinguishing equipment",

Here, among others, the painter Anders Zorn often sat and when the restaurant went bad and close to bankruptcy, Zorn bought it and saved the restaurang. Zorn then donated the restaurant to the Swedish Academy, which still owns it. On Thursdays, the Swedish  Academy dines at the Bellman floor at Gyldene Freden. The Bellman floor is located on the upper floor and consists of three rooms, the living room, the Zorn room and the Bellman room.
